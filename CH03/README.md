In this chapter and the next we will learn
what lists are and how to start working with
the elements in a list. Lists allow us to store
sets of information in one place, whether we
have just a few items or millions of items. Lists are
one of Pythonâ€™s most powerful features readily acces-
sible to new programmers, and they tie together many
important concepts in programming.
